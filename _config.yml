  Hi, my name's Hamza and I'm a python developer. A passionate developer who loves to create secure
  applications that solve real world problems. On a mission to
  become a part of an organization where I can grow as a
  professional and contribute effectively in their vision. In my
  free time, I like to hunt bugs.

  As well as administrating systems I also have experience making software and web apps. I have worked at a number of companies gaining teamwork and leadership skills.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>
